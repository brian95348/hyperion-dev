### Space complexity
Problem size = N</br>
Each recursive call calls the function once</br>
How much is getting reduce on every recursive call? N-1</br>
Memory complexity is determined by the number of return statements because each function call will be stored on the program stack</br>
Recursive function's memory complexity is O(recursion depth)
There we will have n total return statements
Space complexing = __O(n)__
